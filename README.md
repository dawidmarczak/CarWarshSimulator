# Car wash simulator

The project is a simulation of a car wash.

* There is one worker in the car wash, serving two types of clients. 
* The first type are customers for the service car wash, where we define the number of free spaces in the parking lot in advance. 
* The second type are the customers of the maintance-free car wash, who automatically leave the car when there is no free place.
* Customers appear at a predetermined time.
